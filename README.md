The world is changing very fast and so are we with it. Every day, thousands of robots and software programs do jobs that were once done by humans.
Technology encompasses our daily lives and we cannot do without it. We are constantly wondering how to improve, simplify or use it. That's what they're for
necessary ideas, young minds and different thoughts. Today, it is increasingly common to encourage young people in the IT industry through competitions and contests. Hundreds
individuals just come up with fantastic inventions. I got the idea for my final work by looking at the works on the vocational competition of high schools
Worldskills Croatia. I used an Arduino Uno microcontroller as a base, electronic components, sensors and C ++ programming language. A robot that
I made and named "Mile" follows a simple black line on a white background and thus moves autonomously on the marked polygon. The idea of the final work
is to easily simulate autonomous cars without the help of an algorithm, and that any person can make it with little desire. It can be upgraded later
at the request of the user.
